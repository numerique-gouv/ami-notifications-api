## Tech stack

### Language: python

[python](https://docs.python.org) using
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Package and project manager: uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is "An extremely fast Python package and
project manager, written in Rust.", and is used to setup and manage the project.

Please follow the [installation
instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to set it
up on your machine.

Once it's installed, it should be used for everything project related:
- adding more dependencies: `uv add (--dev) <dependency, eg: requests>`
- running a script (or editor) in the project's python environment: `uv run
<command, eg: code>`

### Linter: ruff

[ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is "An extremely fast Python linter and
code formatter, written in Rust."

Ruff is used both for:
- linting: `uv run ruff check --fix`
- formatting: `uv run ruff format`

### API

[litestar](https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/index.html) "is a powerful,
flexible, highly performant, and opinionated ASGI framework."

Start it using:
```sh
uv run litestar run
```

or simply:
```sh
make dev # With live reloading
```

Then access http://127.0.0.1:8000, or open one of:
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema (for ReDoc)
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema/swagger (for Swagger UI)
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema/elements (for Stoplight Elements)
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema/rapidoc (for RapiDoc)

### Database: postgresql

[postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) with
[asyncpg](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/).

If developping locally, and no `DATABASE_URL` env variable is set, it'll default
back to using sqlite.

The `DATABASE_URL` should look like the following:
```
postgresql+asyncpg://[user]:[password]@[url]:[port]/[dbname]
```

For example for a `postgres` database running locally:
```
postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:some_password@localhost:5432/postgres
```
